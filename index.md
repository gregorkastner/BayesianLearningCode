# BayesianLearningCode

BayesianLearningCode provides R code to reproduce (most of the) examples
in a future book.

## Typical use case

Click on **Articles** on top of the page to view the R code.

## Installation

If for some reason you’d like to have the entire package on your
computer, you can do so by installing the development version of
BayesianLearningCode from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("gregorkastner/BayesianLearningCode")
```

Note that this is typically only needed for advanced use cases.
